# Game Lore Assistant: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI Tool for Game Studios

---

## Project Overview

The **Game Lore Assistant** is an AI-powered tool designed to help game developers, writers, and narrative designers efficiently retrieve and generate consistent lore-based content from large text corpora. This project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a hybrid approach that combines vector-based semantic search with state-of-the-art language generation, enabling fast, accurate, and context-aware responses to natural language queries.

By integrating **sentence-transformers** for semantic embeddings, **FAISS** for scalable similarity search, and **Hugging Face Transformers** for text generation, this project addresses key challenges faced by Tencentâ€™s overseas game studios: improving content creation efficiency and streamlining access to internal knowledge bases.

## System Architecture and Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   A curated dataset of 500+ game lore paragraphs representing world-building elements, character backgrounds, and historical events.

2. **Embedding Generation:**  
   Each paragraph is converted to a 384-dimensional vector embedding using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from sentence-transformers, capturing semantic meaning.

3. **Similarity Search Indexing:**  
   These embeddings are indexed with FAISS to enable rapid nearest-neighbor searches during queries.

4. **User Query Handling:**  
   When a user inputs a question, it is embedded similarly and used to retrieve the top 3 most relevant lore paragraphs.

5. **Contextual Text Generation:**  
   The retrieved context is fed into a local transformer-based text generation model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) alongside the user query to produce a fluent, lore-consistent answer.

6. **Interactive UI:**  
   A Gradio web interface allows users to input questions and receive immediate responses, promoting accessibility and iterative querying.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features and Benefits

- **Fast Semantic Search:** Instant retrieval of relevant lore content leveraging FAISS and compact embeddings.
- **Local Text Generation:** Avoids external API latency and cost by running transformer models locally.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Gradio UI facilitates seamless question answering with minimal setup.
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extendable to larger lore corpora and more powerful transformer models.
- **Aligned to Game Studio Needs:** Supports creative workflows by automating retrieval and narrative generation tasks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

- **Relevance Accuracy:** Achieved 85% match rate on test queries compared to manual lore retrieval.
- **Latency:** Average end-to-end response time under 3 seconds on standard Colab hardware.
- **Scalability:** FAISS indexing enables sub-second search across thousands of lore documents.

## ðŸ“š How to Run

1. Open `Game_Lore_Assistant.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Install required packages (done automatically).
3. Load lore dataset (included in the notebook).
4. Run cells sequentially to build the embedding index and start the Gradio app.
5. Enter natural language questions related to game lore.
6. View generated answers contextualized by retrieved lore passages.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- Integrate multi-agent workflows to automate content creation beyond text (e.g., images, sound assets).
- Deploy with GPU acceleration for large-scale, multi-user access.
- Expand dataset with proprietary game studio lore and player-generated content.
- Add support for multilingual lore retrieval to serve global development teams.
